# AWeleczkaSwiftHelperCollection
My "private" collection of helper-snippets I use way too often in projects

---

# Usage
## Recomended is to drop it into your project
You can either use the entire collection (or parts) as is, drop it into your project and you're good to go.

## Alternatively you can obtain this collection through CocoaPods.  
Note that this collection is not published on CocoaPods as it usually would be but I don't bother to setup the stuff I expect around a proper pod (CI, Coverage and so on).  
To include this collection directly through CocoaPods you'll have to add the following line to your `Podfile`  
`pod 'AWeleczkaSwiftHelperCollection', :git => 'https://github.com/AWeleczka/AWeleczkaSwiftHelperCollection.git'`  
this will instruct CocoaPods to use the `.podspec` published in the given repository.  
(If you clone this repository you'll have to change the link of course.)
